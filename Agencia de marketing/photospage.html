<h1>SERVIÇO DE ENSAIO FOTOGRÁFICO</h1>
<h2>FAÇA UMA SEÇÃO DE FOTOS PARA SEU PET!</h2>
<h2></h2>
<p>Having personally documented well over 300 weddings, I have been fortunate enough to document some of the most beautiful weddings all around the globe. I hope you take some time and visit my little corner on the internet, and learn more about how I can be part of your special day. I'm currently based in Los Angeles, but available worldwide where my camera might take me</p>
        
      <p>My work has been seen in all major US wedding publications; such as New York Times, Martha Stewart Weddings, The Knot, Wedding wire, Style Me Pretty and much more. I was also honored to be named Film Photographer of the year by Belle Lumiere Magazine.</p>
        
      <p>Please take a look around the website, and I hope we connect soon!</p>
